# Machine Learning Implementation

The goal of this notebook is to guide anyone thoughout the process of implementing a Machine Learning approach to a certain project. We aim towards creating a step-by-step practical guide; giving cues, coding assistance, ideas, and references to help anyone not get lost along the way of implementation. 

This guide is written in parallel with a machine learning Python library from DCCLab to facilitate the whole process.

1. Data collection
2. Data preparation
3. Model choice and training
4. Model evaluation
5. Optimisation
