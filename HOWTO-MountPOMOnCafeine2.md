# How to mount POM (or any other drive) on Cafeine2 (or any other Mac OS server)

Working in command lines can sometimes be a real pleasure. But for beginners, it can be a real pain.
I hope that this present document will help future students or researchers of the DCCLab to understand the not-so-magic behind command line

## PART 1: Accessing Cafeine2
To access Cafeine2, you need an account (see Daniel for details). When your account is created, you can access Cafeine by command lines.
To do so, open a command prompt (cmd on Windows).

The main command to access the server is `ssh accountName@cafeine2.crulrg.ulaval.ca`
(where, obviously, you replace `accountName` by your account name). Then, the terminal will ask
for your password (if needed, like on Cafeine2). Don't panic if you type your password and nothing appears on screen, your password will
still registered when pressing `Enter`.
