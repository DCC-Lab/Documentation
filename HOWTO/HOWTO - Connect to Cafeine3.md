# How to connect to CAFEINE3/GOLATH/LABDATA

## Some General Knowledge

`cafeine3` is DCCLAB's Virtual Machine running on `dccserver`, the main DCCLAB server where the data and website are. We go through `cafeine3` because it is more secure. This way, if someone messes with `cafeine3`, no problem, we can revert and the data won't be lost. `Goliath` is the name of the 100TB volume on the server. Inside `Goliath`, there's the `/labdata`

- To connect to `cafeine3` console, you can go via `ssh` , use this command: `ssh dcclab@cafeine3.crulrg.ulaval.ca`

- To connect to access the data, there are two ways (Here's the first method) :

    1. You can use the `scp` command. For this, you have to know the path of the file you want to get, or the path where of where you want to put your file.

        - **FROM** *your* computer, COPY a file **TO** `cafeine3`: :  `scp /pathToYourComputerFile dcclab@cafeine3.crulrg.ulaval.ca:/pathWhereItGoes`
