You will find [here](https://github.com/DCC-Lab/Documentation) any documentation for the group. The preferred format is markdown.  An excellent editor is available here: https://typora.io. Markdown is the best because it can be edited and viewed anywhere, including GitHub, is lightweight and simple. Typora supports LaTeX equations. Use Markdown. 

## Organisation of this repository

### Filenames
There is structure to our chaos. Filenames are strictly enforced for clarity. Filenames must be `CATEGORY-Title`. Not everything is a good document name. `CATGEORY` is one of:

1. *GUIDE*: Describes a system and how to use/troubleshoot it.
2. *HOWTO*: Describes the **exact steps** to get something done, usually related to a computer but can be anything
3. *PROTOCOL*: Describes the **technical steps** to complete a small task **in the laboratory**
4. *TECHREP*: Explains or summarizes an article, book, or general concepts

A `Title` is anything informative and short.

### Sources

1. If using LaTeX, Pages, Word, microsoft Paint, excel whatever:
   1.  Put the PDF doc on the start page. 
   2.  Put its editable file in a folder of the same name. Put this folder in folder 'Sources'.
2. Markdown does not need a PDF



## How to write for DCClab

Keeping documentation for the group is a difficult task if there are no standards. Hence, here are the various standards anyone must follow:

1. Documents are in english

2. Be clear, be concise but complete.
