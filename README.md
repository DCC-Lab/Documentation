## How to link GitHub to your LaTex account
1. Go to v2.overleaf.com. 
2. Log in with a Overleaf account (not Sharelatex).
3. Click on 'New Project' --> 'Import from GitHub'.
4. Follow the instructions.
5. When asked, click on 'Request' next to all repositories you would like to have access to from your latex account. You should not need to request 'DCC-Lab' since Daniel has already given access to all people in DCC-Lab organization.
6. Authorise access.
7. Go back.
8. Once your latex account is linked to your GitHub account, redo step 2. 
9. Now all your available repositories should be listed. Click on 'Import to ###' next to the repository you want.
10. To push and pull, go to 'Menu' --> 'Sync' --> 'GitHub'.
